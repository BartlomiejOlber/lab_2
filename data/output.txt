TO OKH/OP. ABT. AND TO OKH/FOREIGN ARMIES EAST, FROM ARMY GROUP SOUTH IA/01, NO. 411/43, 
SIGNED VON WEICHS, GENERAL FELDMARSCHALL, DATED 25/4:- COMPREHENSIVE APPRECIATION OF THE ENEMY 
FOR 'ZITADELLE' IN THE MAIN THE APPRECIATION OF THE ENEMY REMAINS THE SAME AS REPORTED IN ARMY
GROUP SOUTH (ROMAN) IIA, NO. 0477/43 OF 29/3 AND IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY APPRECIATION OF 15/4. THE
MAIN CONCENTRATION, WHICH WAS ALREADY THEN APPARENT ON THE NORTH FLANK OF THE ARMY GROUP IN THE 
GENERAL AREA KURSK--SSUDSHA--VOLCHANSK--OSTROGOSHSK, CAN NOW BE CLEARLY RECOGNISED: A FURTHER 
INTENSIFICATION OF THIS CONCENTRATION IS TO BE EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUOUS HEAVY TRANSPORT
MOVEMENTS ON THE LINES YELETS--KASTORNOYE--KURSK, AND POVORINO--SVOBODA AND GRYAZI--SVOBODA, WITH A 
PROBABLE (B% INCREASE) IN THE AREA VALUIKI--NOVY OSKOL--KUPYANSK. AT PRESENT HOWEVER IT IS NOT APPARENT
WHETHER THE OBJECT OF THIS CONCENTRATION IS OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE. AT PRESENT, (B% STILL) IN ANTICIPATION 
OF A GERMAN OFFENSIVE ON BOTH THE KURSK AND MIUS DONETZ FRONTS, THE ARMOURED AND MOBILE FORMATIONS ARE STILL
EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IN VARIOUS GROUPS BEHIND THE FRONT AS STRATEGIC RESERVES. THERE ARE NO SIGNS AS YET OF A
MERGING OF THESE FORMATIONS OR A TRANSFER TO THE FORWARD AREA (EXCEPT FOR (ROMAN) II GDS GUARDS ARMOURED
CORPS) BUT THIS COULD TAKE PLACE RAPIDLY AT ANY TIME. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION FROM A SURE SOURCE THE EXISTENCE 
OF THE FOLLOWING GROUPS OF THE STRATEGIC RESERVE CAN BE PRESUMED:- A) 2 CAVALRY CORPS (III GDS AND V GDS IN THE 
AREA NORTH OF NOVOCHERKASSK). IT CAN ALSO BE PRESUMED THAT 1 MECH MECHANISED CORPS (V GDS) IS BEING BROUGHT UP
TO STRENGTH HERE. B) 1 MECH CORPS (III GDS) IN THE AREA (B% NORTH) OF ROWENKI. C) 1 ARMOURED CORPS, 1 CAVALRY 
CORPS AND PROBABLY 2 MECH CORPS ((ROMAN) I GD ARMOURED, IV CAVALRY, PROBABLY (B% (ROMAN) I) GDS MECH AND V MECH
CORPS) IN THE AREA NORTH OF VOROSHILOVGRAD. D) 2 CAVALRY CORPS ((B% IV) GDS AND VII GDS) IN THE AREA WEST OF
STAROBYELSK. E) 1 MECH CORPS, 1 CAVALRY CORPS AND 2 ARMOURED CORPS ((ROMAN) I GDS (B% MECH), (ROMAN) I GDS
CAVALRY, (ROMAN) II AND XXIII ARMOURED) IN THE AREA OF KUPYANSK--SVATOVO. F) 3 ARMOURED CORPS, 1 MECH CORPS ((ROMAN) II 
ARMOURED, V GDS ARMOURED, (B% XXIX) ARMOURED AND V GDS MECH UNDER THE COMMAND OF AN ARMY (PERHAPS 5 ARMOURED ARMY)) IN THE
AREA OF OSTROGOSHSK. G) 2 ARMOURED AND 1 CAVALRY CORPS ((ROMAN) II GDS ARMOURED, III GDS ARMOURED AND VI GDS CAVALRY) UNDER 
THE COMMAND OF AN UNIDENTIFIED H.Q., IN THE AREA NORTH OF NOVY OSKOL. IN THE EVENT OF 'ZITADELLE', THERE ARE AT PRESENT 
APPROXIMATELY 90 ENEMY FORMATIONS WEST OF THE LINE BELGOROD--KURSK--MALOARKHANGELSK. THE ATTACK OF THE ARMY GROUP WILL 
ENCOUNTER STUBBORN ENEMY RESISTANCE IN A DEEPLY ECHELONED AND WELL DEVELOPED MAIN DEFENCE ZONE, (WITH NUMEROUS DUG IN TANKS, 
STRONG ARTILLERY AND LOCAL RESERVES) THE MAIN EFFORT OF THE DEFENCE BEING IN THE KEY SECTOR BELGOROD--TAMAROVKA. IN ADDITION 
STRONG COUNTER ATTACKS BY STRATEGIC RESERVES FROM EAST AND SOUTHEAST ARE TO BE EXPECTED. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST WHETHER 
THE ENEMY WILL ATTEMPT TO WITHDRAW FROM A THREATENED ENCIRCLEMENT BY RETIRING EASTWARDS, AS SOON AS THE KEY SECTORS 
LITERALLY, 'CORNER-PILLARS' OF THE BULGE IN THE FRONTLINE AT KURSK, BELGOROD AND MALOARKHANGELSK, HAVE BEEN BROKEN 
THROUGH. IF THE ENEMY THROWS IN ALL STRATEGIC RESERVES ON THE ARMY GROUP FRONT INTO THE KURSK BATTLE, THE FOLLOWING MAY 
APPEAR ON THE BATTLE FIELD:- ON DAY 1 AND DAY 2, 2 ARMOURED DIVISIONS AND 1 CAVALRY CORPS. ON DAY 3, 2 MECH AND 4 ARMOURED 
CORPS. ON DAY 4, 1 ARMOURED AND 1 CAVALRY CORPS. ON DAY 5, 3 MECH CORPS. ON DAY 6, 3 CAVALRY CORPS. ON DAY 6 AND/OR DAY 7,
2 CAVALRY CORPS. SUMMARIZING, IT CAN BE STATED THAT THE BALANCE OF EVIDENCE STILL POINTS TO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE ON THE 
PART OF THE ENEMY: AND THIS IS IN FACT UNMISTAKABLE IN THE FRONTAL SECTORS OF THE 6 ARMY AND 1 PANZER ARMY. IF THE BRINGING 
UP OF FURTHER FORCES IN THE AREA BEFORE THE NORTH WING OF THE ARMY GROUP PERSISTS AND IF A TRANSFER FORWARD AND MERGING OF 
THE MOBILE AND ARMOURED FORMATIONS THEN TAKES PLACE, OFFENSIVE INTENTIONS BECOME MORE PROBABLE. IN THAT CASE IT IS 
IMPROBABLE THAT THE ENEMY CAN EVEN THEN FORESTALL OUR EXECUTION OF ZITADELLE IN THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS. PROBABLY ON 
HE OTHER HAND WE MUST ASSUME COMPLETE ENEMY PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENCE, INCLUDING THE COUNTER ATTACKS OF HIS STRONG MOT 
MOTORISED AND ARMOURED FORCES, WHICH MUST BE EXPECTED. (BY PERMISSION OF OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, COLOSSUS: THE SECRETS
